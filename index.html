        <p>Detailed visualizations representing global trade patterns and their dynamics over the years.</p>

        <!-- Choropleth Map -->
        <h2>Choropleth Map: Global Import Patterns</h2>
        <p>This map shows the global import consumption trends in 2021 through 
            color shades. Dark colors represent countries with high import values, while light colors represent 
            countries with low import values. It can be observed from the figure that regions 
            such as North America, Europe, parts of Asia and Australia are darker, which means their 
            import values are higher; while regions in Africa and parts of South America are lighter, and their import 
            values may be lower. This visualization helps us understand global trade dynamics.</p>

        <!-- Scatter Plot -->
        <h2>Scatter Plot: Comparative Analysis of Country Growth versus Trade Weighted Average for 2015-2021</h2>
        <p>This scatter plot for 2015 visualizes the relationship between countries' growth rates and their 
            AHS weighted averages, likely indicating trade tariffs. Most countries cluster near zero growth with low tariffs, 
            but outliers like Argentina showcase deviations. Essentially, the chart offers a snapshot of economic growth in relation to trade duties for various countries.</p>

        <!-- Bubble Chart -->
        <h2>Bubble Chart: Visualizing Trade Balance in Relation to Country and Global Growth Rates for 2015-2021</h2>
        <p>The Bubble Chart for 2015 illustrates the relationship between individual countries' growth rates and world growth, with the size of each bubble 
            denoting the magnitude of a country's trade balance. Larger bubbles represent significant trade surpluses or deficits, offering insights into countries' 
            economic positions relative to global growth. Essentially, this visualization provides a concise overview of how countries' trade balances align with their growth rates in comparison to worldwide economic performance.</p>

              <p>This heatmap displays the evolution of trade dynamics from 2015 to 2021 based on the MFN (Most Favored Nation) Simple Average percentages. The shades of blue represent the 
                  magnitude of the MFN Simple Average, with darker hues indicating higher percentages, thus signifying robust trade dynamics. The countries showcased, such as Burundi, Croatia, 
                  and Iceland, to name a few, are the top 10 performers based on their trade percentages within this period. This visualization provides a concise and comprehensive view of how 
                  trade has progressed for these leading countries over seven years.</p>
